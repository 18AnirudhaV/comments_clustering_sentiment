# Clustered YouTube Comments with Sentiment Analysis
Scraping comments from YouTube videos and clustering the text to summarize key points made to help improve future content with sentiment analysis to help determine if the overall feedback of the video is negative or positive.

## Problem Statement
One of the best ratios for measuring YouTube video success is comments vs views. As any channel or video grows the amount of comments per video grows. Increasing the difficulty for content creators to read all their comments and improve their videos. The task is to summarize all these comments and create a short paragraph that can be quickly read to understand the key points viewers are making. Using sentiment analysis to generalize if the summary is positive or negative tied with the likes on each comment as weights to determine what should be highlighted.
